Control of industrial robotic manipulator through motion tracking with  computer vision

ABSTRACT

This work presents the development of an interface for controlling an industrial robotic arm based on human hand movements, using computer vision and the Kinect sensor. The proposal aims to offer an educational and interactive alternative to conventional robot programming through pose and keypoint detection using a Kinect sensor, followed by the conversion of this data into motion commands. The implementation involved the use of specialized libraries, integration with the Epson robot controller API, and validation of movement in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the system for educational and demonstration purposes, although its low precision and repeatability make it unsuitable for industrial applications requiring a high degree of accuracy. Finally, improvements are suggested, such as the use of more modern sensors and real-time processing implementation, to increase the robustness and applicability of the solution.
